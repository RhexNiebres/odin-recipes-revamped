    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook

      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown,

      <li>
        Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black

      <li>
        Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil.

        cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
